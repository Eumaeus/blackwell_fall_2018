Test your typing by pasting each sentence into the [Type Greek](http://folio.furman.edu/type/) webpage. In your file, have the beta-code on one line, followed by a blank line, followed by the Unicode version produced by the web-app:

> `o( *o(/mhros to\n a)/nqrwpon paideu/ei.`
> 
> ὁ Ὅμηρος τὸν ἄνθρωπον παιδεύει.

Do not include the numbers, or any text except a beta-code / unicode pair for each sentence.

## Reflection

The Furman Advantage cites "reflection" as a key component. In this class, "reflection" (which could mean anything), will mean "the ability to talk about what you have done in terms meaningful to people outside of the University".

> Linux is the operating system that hosts the information economy. Scientific research projects, the rendering of animated films, banking, manufacturing processes all tend to run on Linux because it is powerful, capable, and free to use and customize. As you work on Classics at Furman University, you will gain basic (and some not-so-basic) skills with Linux. **A basic knowledge of Linux is a marketable skill.** At the end of this course, you can add to your resumé: "Experience working with Linux (Ubuntu server, v.14) in a virtualized environment."
