# Greek 110, Fall 2018

## Reflection

Linux is the operating system that hosts the information economy. Scientific research projects, the rendering of animated films, banking, manufacturing processes all tend to run on Linux because it is powerful, capable, and free to use and customize. As you work on Classics at Furman University, you will gain basic (and some not-so-basic) skills with Linux. **A basic knowledge of Linus is a marketable skill.** Add to your resumé: "Experience working with Linux (Ubuntu server, v.14) in a virtualized environment."
