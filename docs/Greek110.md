- For Monday, September 24: Prepare Unit 1 Exercises, on p. 36, numbers 1-10. That is, type them out into a file named "unit1.txt" in `~/Desktop/fall2018vm/ez-morph/documents/`, be able to read them aloud in Greek, and make a first attempt at translating them. **Also**, study for a short quiz on the definite article: given a form, *e.g.* τήν, give its gender, case, and number ("feminine, accusative, singular" for τήν).
- For Friday, September 21: Study the forms of the definite article. The quiz will be on producing the 24 forms, as last time. Try to come to class with Atom up and running, as well as your VM. 
- For Thursday, September 20: Take notes on the Vocabulary for Chapter 1. [Validate with the Virtual Machine.](https://eumaeus.github.io/fall2018vm/). 
- For Tuesday, September 18: [Be able to start, log in to, log out of, and stop the Virtual Machine](https://eumaeus.github.io/fall2018vm/). **Learn the forms of the definite article (p. 28) and be able to write them out, in order, for a quiz.**

- For September 11: In a file named `exercises_1.txt`, type out in Beta-code Unit 1 Exercises, 1-10, on p. 36. Test your typing by pasting each sentence into the [Type Greek](http://folio.furman.edu/type/) webpage. In your file, have the beta-code on one line, followed by a blank line, followed by the Unicode version produced by the web-app:

> `o( *o(/mhros to\n a)/nqrwpon paideu/ei.`
> 
> ὁ Ὅμηρος τὸν ἄνθρωπον παιδεύει.

Do not include the numbers, or any text except a beta-code / unicode pair for each sentence.

- For September 6: Windows users: Download and install the [Git for Windows Installer](https://gitforwindows.org/). Mac users: Go to the Mac App Store; download and install XCode. Go to <http://folio.furman.edu/type/> and practice typing Beta Code by typing Pronunciation Exercise IV on p. 12. Print out the Unicode output to hand in for a quiz grade.

## Reflection

The Furman Advantage cites "reflection" as a key component. In this class, "reflection" (which could mean anything), will mean "the ability to talk about what you have done in terms meaningful to people outside of the University".

> Linux is the operating system that hosts the information economy. Scientific research projects, the rendering of animated films, banking, manufacturing processes all tend to run on Linux because it is powerful, capable, and free to use and customize. As you work on Classics at Furman University, you will gain basic (and some not-so-basic) skills with Linux. **A basic knowledge of Linux is a marketable skill.** At the end of this course, you can add to your resumé: "Experience working with Linux (Ubuntu server, v.14) in a virtualized environment."
