## General Information

### Virtual Machine Environment

Because students have a variety of computers—Macs and various Windows machines—we will do all of our computational work in a *virtual machine environment*, which lets us all have the same environment. After installing two pieces of (free) software for your particular computer, you will download a folder of files that tell the software how to "build" a Linux computer that runs inside your (physical) computer. You will learn how to start that virtual computer, work in it, get out of it, and stop it.
