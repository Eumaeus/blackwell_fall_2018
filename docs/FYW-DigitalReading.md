## Assignments
 
(New assignments will be added to the top.)

1. For **Monday, September 10**. Read the (opinionated) essay[“Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient,” Allin Cottrell](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html). Write a five-sentence (no more, no fewer) summary of the article. Expect to read your summary aloud to the class.

1. For **Friday, September 7**. Rewrite your instructions, incorporating your classmates advice for improvements (or not). Hand in the first draft, perhaps marked up, and a new one. Windows users: Download and install the [Git for Windows Installer](https://gitforwindows.org/); agree to all the default settings in the installer. Mac users: Locate the Terminal application that is on your computer, at `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`; open it. Everyone: Download and install the Atom text editor <https://atom.io>. **File for demonstrating a digital text [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6doem04krei59es/FYW-DigitalReading.md?dl=0).**

1. For **Wednesday, September 5**. Write a short set of instructions or recipe teaching a stranger how to do something—make a sandwich, make a milkshake, change a lightbulb. Bring this, typed out and printed, to class and be prepared to share it with your classmates. *Keep the file on your computer in some place where you can find it; we will be working with this more in the future.*

1. [Knowing Your Tools] For **Friday, August 31**: (a) Bring your computer to class. (b) Bring the following information, typed and printed on a piece of paper: first, the *make and model* of your computer, and second, the *version* of its operating system. *Write this information as complete sentences,* for example: 

> "I have a MacBook (Retina, 12 inch, 2017) laptop running macOS High Sierra (10.13.6)."

> "I have a Dell Latitude E6480 laptop running Windows 10 Enterprise v.1803."

## Reflection

The Furman Advantage cites "reflection" as a key component. In this class, "reflection" (which could mean anything), will mean "the ability to talk about what you have done in terms meaningful to people outside of the University".

> Linux is the operating system that hosts the information economy. Scientific research projects, the rendering of animated films, banking, manufacturing processes all tend to run on Linux because it is powerful, capable, and free to use and customize. As you work on Classics at Furman University, you will gain basic (and some not-so-basic) skills with Linux. **A basic knowledge of Linux is a marketable skill.** At the end of this course, you can add to your resumé: "Experience working with Linux (Ubuntu server, v.14) in a virtualized environment."

> `Git` is (in 2018) the standard **distributed version control** system in the world of information technology. Collaborative work on digital data will be *ubiquitous* across all professions in the future. At the end of this course, you can add to your resumé: "Experience working on a team-based data science project using Git and GitHub via the Linux command-line."
