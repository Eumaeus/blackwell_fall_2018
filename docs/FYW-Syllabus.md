# FYW-1293, "Digital Reading; Digital Writing" Syllabus

C. Blackwell, Department of Classics

MWF 02:30PM - 03:20PM

Furman Hall 119

## Overview

I designed this class hoping that it would introduce you to your Liberal Arts education and help set you up to be successful. I want to help you be a better writer, where "better" means:

- You can write more clearly.
- Your writing is more interesting…
	- …because you are a more interesting writer,
	- …and because you avoid boring topics.
- You write more quickly.
- You can say what you have to say more briefly.
- You are more skilled and confident with your tools.
- You have a greatly enhanced historical perspective on the whole business of "scratching magical symbols that conjure voices although no one is present," or, as we say these days, "writing".
- You have a swanky job because you combine the wisdom and insight of the Liberal Arts with specific 21st Century marketable skills.

**More specifically** in this course you will:

- Discuss reading and writing in history and particularly in the present digital age.
- Do various exercises in writing.
- Criticize your classmates' writing and be criticized in return (but always nicely).
- Discuss "information fluency". Learn how to cite your work, why to cite your work, and how to avoid ever having to type a bibliography.
- Learn specific computational skills.
- Edit and publish a **validated and verified digital edition of a text**.
