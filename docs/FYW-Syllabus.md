# FYW-1293, "Digital Reading; Digital Writing" Syllabus

C. Blackwell, Department of Classics

MWF 02:30PM - 03:20PM

Furman Hall 119

## Overview

I designed this class hoping that it would introduce you to your Liberal Arts education and help set you up to be successful. I want to help you be a better writer, where "better" means:

- You can write more clearly.
- Your writing is more interesting…
	- …because you are a more interesting writer,
	- …and because you avoid boring topics.
- You write more quickly.
- You can say what you have to say more briefly.
- You are more skilled and confident with your tools.
- You have a greatly enhanced historical perspective on the whole business of "scratching magical symbols that conjure voices although no one is present," or, as we say these days, "writing".
- You have a swanky job because you combine the wisdom and insight of the Liberal Arts with specific 21st Century marketable skills.

**More specifically** in this course you will:

- Discuss reading and writing in history and particularly in the present digital age.
- Do various exercises in writing.
- Criticize your classmates' writing and be criticized in return (but always nicely).
- Discuss "information fluency". Learn how to cite your work, why to cite your work, and how to avoid ever having to type a bibliography.
- Learn specific computational skills.
- Edit and publish a **validated and verified digital edition of a text**.

### Notes

- **Quizzes** These will be daily affairs, very short. You will grade your own. (We will talk about how this works in class). If you are not present, you will earn a zero. If you are present and hand *anything* in, you will earn at least 80% for that quiz. If you score more than 80% on a quiz, you will earn what you score. I will drop any zero resulting from an excused absence. I will drop any three other zeros.
- **Short Assignments** 
- **Final Essay**
- **Project** 
- **Engagement** This will be my subjective assessment of your engagement with the material *and with the class*. The class is a team engaged in solving a problem: how to read Greek. As a member of that team you are expected to be supportive, active, respectful, cheerful, and as helpful as you can. Each member of the class will bring particular strengths.
- **Resourcefullness** You are not yet good at Greek, nor are you good at the tools and techniques we will learn. This will be my subjective assessment of the extent to which you work to help yourself, to solve your own problem, to find answers to your questions, and to avoid being generally helpless.
