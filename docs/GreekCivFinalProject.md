# Greek Civilization (CLS-222), Fall 2018: Final Project

## Overview

I want you each to engage in the text of Herodotus in some significant way that can have an audience of more than one. I have an open mind about what you do.

## Grading

- `A` (90–100): Correct, attractive, insightful. Nothing much to improve on.
- `B` (80–89): Like an A, but with rougher edges. 
- `C` (75): A legitimate stab at a good project, handed in.
- `D` (65): Handed in.

## Topics

- **Business-style visualizations.** Timeline of narrative. See <https://www.visme.co/timeline-maker/> or <https://time.graphics> for example. Using either Herodotus 1.1–1.93 or 5.30–5.94, prepare a graphical visualization of how Herodotus' narrative moves back and forth in time. You may have to be creative. You might take advantage of the "Dated Outline of Text" in the introduction to Strassler's *Landmark Herodotus*. This would be a nice portfolio piece for anyone going into business or communications-related fields.
- **More Placenames!** Help me get complete coverage of placenames in Hdt. Book 1 and Book 5. You will have to find places, double-check them, and assemble that data into a *specificly formatted file format*. This will be an exercise in close reading, in geography, and in *doing a thing correctly.*
- **Illustrating Herodotus**. Pick a story, episode, or selection of passages: The myths in the "Persian Version", Arion and the Dolphin, the list of gifts Croesus made to Delphi, and prepare an *illustrated index* consisting of (a) a citation to a passage, and (b) a URL to an *openly licensed* image that *somehow* illustrates the passage. You can be creative about this. You will be expected to submit this in a *specificly formatted file format*.
- **Word-study paper**. Using searching and N-Gram analysis of Herodotus in English and/or Greek, find something interesting and write about it. In the process, help me clean up my digital edition of Herodotus by documenting errors in a digital edition and helping to fix them. See <http://folio.furman.edu/herodotus.html>.
- **Something else?** Feel free to pitch me an idea. The rules are (i) engagement with Herodotus, (ii) something someone other than me might find interesting, and (iii) it serves you in some way. Topics: Delphi, Magi, "tyrant", sex?
