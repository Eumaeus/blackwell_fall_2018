# GRK-110, Elementary Ancient Greek

C. Blackwell, Department of Classics

MTHF 08:30–09:20

Furman Hall 111

## Overview

In this class you will learn the basics of the ancient Greek language. This is a very difficult challenge. To meet this challenge we will address Greek vocabulary, morphology, grammar, and syntax (and what those terms mean!). We will talk about the language, its history and relationship to other languages, and about tools for working with Greek. To help you learn, and to give you some specific marketable skills relevant to the 21st century, you will work hands-on building your own digital tools for analyzing Greek.

## Resources

- Hansen, Hardy, and Gerald M. Quinn. *Greek: An Intensive Course, 2nd Revised Edition.* Fordham University Press, 1992.

## Assignments & Dates

1. For August 30: Given the *name* of a Greek letter, be able to write it in upper- and lower-case. Understand the difference between "character/grapheme" and "letterform/glyph". Know what a "diacritical mark" is.

### Notes

- **Quizzes** These will be daily affairs, very short. You will grade your own. (We will talk about how this works in class). If you are not present, you will earn a zero. If you are present and hand *anything* in, you will earn at least 80% for that quiz. If you score more than 80% on a quiz, you will earn what you score. I will drop any zero resulting from an excused absence. I will drop any three other zeros.
- **Exams** These will be tests of your understanding and skill more than tests of your memory. The final exam will be a one-on-one session with me.
- **Engagement** This will be my subjective assessment of your engagement with the material *and with the class*. The class is a team engaged in solving a problem: how to read Greek. As a member of that team you are expected to be supportive, active, respectful, cheerful, and as helpful as you can. Each member of the class will bring particular strengths.
- **Resourcefullness** You are not yet good at Greek, nor are you good at the tools and techniques we will learn. This will be my subjective assessment of the extent to which you work to help yourself, to solve your own problem, to find answers to your questions, and to avoid being generally helpless.
