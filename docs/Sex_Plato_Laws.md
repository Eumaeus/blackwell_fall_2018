## Plato's *Laws* and Sex

The *Laws* is a philosophical *dialogue* written by the Athenian Plato in the early 4th Century BCE (that is, the high-numbered 300s).

A fictional conversation between an "Athenian Stranger" and two men from Crete named Clinias and Megillus. The dramatic setting is Crete, and during the conversation it emerges that Clinias has been charged with writing a new body of laws for a new city. The dialogue is incredibly long, but the excerpt below includes the part where the Athenian and the Cretans talk about laws and sex.

I am not presenting this a evidence for "the ancient Greeks' attitudes toward sexuality", since "the ancient Greeks" were a vast heterogenous people living between France and the Indus River, between Romania and Ethiopia, from 1,500 BC to 1453 CE (to cut off "ancient" arbitarily), and therefore were unlikely to have had one, or even merely a few thousand, distinct views of sexuality. Furthermore, this dialogue is a work of fiction in which one character proposes an "ideal" set of laws to two other, skeptical, characters. But this passage represents *some* plausibly realistic 4th Century BCE attitudes toward certain aspects of sexuality and its relationship to government, and raises some issues that might prompt conversation.

Passage: Plato, *Laws*, 836b–838d, translated (for the most part) by John Burnet, 1903. I have made a few minor deletions for the sake of clarity. I have interleaved my own thoughts and observations, as prompts for conversation; these are in blue. I also re-translated a part in the middle where Professor Burnet made the translation say the opposite of what the Greek actually says. We can talk about that.

**A note on reading Platonic Dialogues:** It is tempting to see the long utterances of the central character, Socrates in many dialogues, "the Athenian stranger" here, as straightforward expressions of a thesis. But it might be worth considering that these utterances are supposed to be read critically; perhaps sometimes they are ironic or paradoxical.

**A final note on “digital humanities”** Dr. Nair did not invite me to talk about computer stuff, but it is what I do most of the time. At the very end of our discussion, I can say a few things about how computational work in the humanities can be useful, *particularly* for scholars interested in exploring ancient attitudes toward issues that, in recent centuries, became controversial.

## The Reading from Plato

**Athenian** But when we come to the amorous passions of children of both sexes and of men for women and women for men—passions which have been the cause of countless woes both to individuals and to whole States—how is one to guard against these, or what remedy can one apply so as to find a way of escape in all such cases from a danger such as this? 

> Observation: Sex has always been something communities, cities, states, government have had to contend with. Sex is a powerful impulse, even among children according to the Athenian, and like all powerful implulses it can cause problems.

It is extremely difficult, Clinias. For whereas, in regard to many other matters, Crete generally and Sparta furnish us (and rightly) with great help in the framing of laws which differ from those in common use, but in regard to the passions of sex (for we are alone by ourselves) they contradict us absolutely.

> The cities of Crete ("Crete generally") and Sparta evidently (a) had laws about sex, and (b) had different laws about sex from those of Athens.

If we were to follow in nature's steps and enact that law which held good before the days of Laius[^laius], declaring that it is right to refrain from indulging in the same kind of intercourse with men and boys as with women, and adducing as evidence thereof the nature of wild beasts, and pointing out how male does not touch male for this purpose, since it is unnatural—in all this we would probably be using an argument neither convincing nor in any way consonant with your States. 

> So, according to this unnamed Athenian, there was once a law (in Thebes? in Athens?) against sex between men, based on some assumption about what is "natural". Evidently this law fell out of use after Laius was king of Thebes which was "a long time ago" (since Laius is a mythological figure). Now, according to the Athenian, to go back to that law would not be "consonant" with whatever happens in the cities of Crete.
 
Moreover, that object which, as we affirm, the lawgiver ought always to have in view does not agree this law. For the enquiry we always make is this: Does the proposed law tend toward virtue and which do not? 

Come then, suppose we grant that we adopt this proposed law, and that it is noble and in no way ignoble, how far would it promote virtue? Will it engender in the soul of him who is seduced a courageous character, or in the soul of the seducer the quality of temperance? Nobody would ever believe this.…

Is there any man, then, who will ordain such a law? Not one, I should say, if he has a notion of what true law is. What then do we declare to be the truth about this matter? It is necessary to discern the real nature of friendship and desire and love (so-called), if we are to determine them rightly; for what causes the utmost confusion and obscurity is the fact that this single term embraces these two things, and also a third kind compounded of them both.

> Note on the above three paragraphs. I re-translated the above three paragraphs. As I read the Greek, the Athenian is saying that "you can't create virtue by making laws about sex." I am confident that I can defend my translation, but you will have to take my word for it for the moment. Burnet's translation replaces "this", "this law", and "the thing I just mentioned"—words and phrases that I think can only refer to τὸν νόμον ("the law") that existed before Laius—with "these practices." In other words, where the passage here is talking about the *law against sex between men*, Burnet in 1906 translated it as though it were talking about *sex between men.* If you want to read Burnet's translation, it is here: https://goo.gl/LaQox5 (the word "Moreover" is where I think he tries to steer the train onto another track).

[^laius]: Mythological king of Thebes, father of Oedipus. Patriarch of a family whose sexual history is not necessarily a model for emulation.

**Clinias** How so?

**Athenian** Friendship is the name we give to the affection of like for like, in point of goodness, and of equal for equal; and also to that of the needy for the rich, which is of the opposite kind; and when either of these feelings is intense we call it “love.” [837b]

**Clinias** True.

**Athenian** The friendship which occurs between *people in opposing positions* is terrible and fierce and seldom reciprocal amongst men, while that based on similarity is gentle and reciprocal throughout life. … He that is in love with the body  and hungering after its bloom, as it were that of a ripening peach, urges himself on to take his fill of it, paying no respect to the disposition of the beloved. 

> So here the Athenian is talking about love between men, but (it seems to me) only incidentally. I italicized *people in opposing positions* (Greek ἐναντίων, *enantiōn*), because it is hard to know what it means here. How are two men "opposites"? Opposites in power or status? "Frenemies"? My guess: this means *opposites in power*. He mentioned above "that [affection] of the needy for the rich, which is of the opposite kind", which suggests that "opposite" means "of different levels of power." This might be why he mentions "amongst men", since in the world of Athens, a man and a woman are *always* in an unequal power relationship. If he wants to talk about "love between equals" versus "love between unequals", he has to use two men as an example.

Whereas he that counts bodily desire as but secondary, and puts longing looks in place of love, with soul lusting really for soul, regards the bodily satisfaction of the body as an outrage, and, reverently worshipping temperance, courage, nobility and wisdom, will desire to live always chastely in company with the chaste object of his love. 

> So there is the power-lust-body kind of love, and the I-love-your-inner-self kind of love. And at this point, it seems that the sex or gender of the parties is no longer part of the conversation.

But the love which is blended of these two kinds is that which we have described just now as third. Since, then, love has so many varieties, ought the law to prohibit them all and prevent them from existing in our midst? Or shall we not plainly wish that the kind of love which belongs to virtue and which desires the young to be as good as possible should exist within our State, while we shall prohibit, if possible, the other kinds? Or what is our view, my dear Megillus?

> And this third kind is the most realistic, some mixture of the two. The Athenian's point seems to be that, on the one hand, it is silly to prohibit love and sex categorially, but love and sex should be regulated *to some extent*, but doing so is complicated.

**Megillus** Your description of the subject, Stranger, is perfectly correct.

…

**Athenian** Even at present, as we are aware, most men, however lawless they are, are effectively and strictly precluded from sexual commerce with beautiful persons,—and that not against their will, but with their own most willing consent.

**Megillus** On what occasions do you mean?

**Athenian** Whenever any man has a brother or sister who is beautiful. So too in the case of a son or daughter, the same unwritten law is most effective in guarding men from sleeping with them, either openly or secretly, or wishing to have any connection with them,—nay, most men never so much as feel any desire for such connection.

> The Athenian brings up incest. I think it is interesting that he does not take it in the direction of a "slippery slope" argument, but in another direction: that what is or isn't right is a matter of consensus in the community, and that the arts can shape society.

**Megillus** That is true.

**Athenian** Is it not, then, by a brief sentence that all such pleasures are quenched?

**Megillus** What sentence do you mean?

**Athenian** The sentence that these acts are by no means holy, but hated of God and most shamefully shameful. And does not the reason lie in this, that nobody speaks of them otherwise, but every one of us, from the day of his birth, hears this opinion expressed always and everywhere, not only in comic speech, but often also in serious tragedy—as when there is brought on to the stage a Thyestes or an Oedipus, or a Macareus having secret intercourse with a sister, and all these are seen inflicting death upon themselves willingly as a punishment for their sins?

**Megillus** Thus much at least you are quite right in saying—that public opinion has a surprising influence, when there is no attempt by anybody ever to breathe a word that contradicts the law.

> And from there the argument goes off in the direction that Platonic dialogues usually take: What is really necessary is not a huge body of specific laws, but a society given over to philosophy, where everyone contemplates truth and beauty and is therefore able to navigate complex issues under changing and uncertain conditions, bringing abstract and critical thinking to bear on the practical needs of life. Or, in other words, society should be a big Liberal Arts colleges enacting The Furman Advantage.
