# FYW · Final Git Submission

## Steps

Get the template file I made for you.

- Navigate (with `cd` ) to the folder where you checked out your personal Git repository. This is the one where your paper is.
- `git pull`
- There should be a file called `narrative.md` in there. Add your reflection piece to that file.
- `git add narrative.md`
- `git add [name of your paper].md`
- `git commit -m "Checking in final submission"`
- `git push`
- Send me an email saying you have done so.
