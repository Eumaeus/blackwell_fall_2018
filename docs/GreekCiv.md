The Furman Advantage cites "reflection" as a key component. In this class, "reflection" (which could mean anything), will mean "the ability to talk about what you have done in terms meaningful to people outside of the University".

> Many parts of Herodotus, particularly Book 1, are self-contained stories; these can often read very much like the parables found in the New Testament. Like those parables, the stories from Herodotus can often apply to modern situations and provide insight. Unlike those parables, the stories from Herodotus are not that widely known. If you can remember a small handful of what you will read in this semester, you can use them later—in business, in conversation—to cast ancient light on modern problems.
