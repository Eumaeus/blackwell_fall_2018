## Assignments & Dates

(Newer assignments are added at the top of the list)

- For Tuesday, Sept. 4: Read Herodotus 1.1-1.5 (pp. 3–5). *Write out* the following:
	1. Whose account this is.
	1. A short list of who kidnapped whom.
	1. Based on Wikipedia, a one sentence (each) desscription of [Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(mythology), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(mythology), [Medea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea), [Helen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy).
	1. A one-sentence summary of Herodotus' own opinion of the stories he has just related.
- For Thursday, August 30: Read the Introduction to Herodotus by Rosalind Thomas, starting on page ix, sections 1.1–2.3. *Write a very, very short summary of each of those sections (there are 5 of them)*. Ideally, one sentence per section, which means you will have to boil each section down to its essence. If you must write two or three sentences to summarize a section, so be it, but **do not write more than 10 sentences in all**. Bring your summaries to class to hand in as a first quiz grade.

## Topics Discussed

- Dates: BCE/CE, BC/AD. 5th Century BCE (400s).
- Basic geography: The Greek world is focused on the Aegean sea. Halicarnassus and Athens. Where "Barbarians" live.
- "Hellene" = "Greek person"; "Hellas" = "Greece"; "Hellenic" = "Greek". But *n.b.* "Hellas" for Herodotus means "wherever in the world there are people who speak Greek, share Greek customs, and worship the same gods." There was no political entity called "Hellas".

## Reflection

The Furman Advantage cites "reflection" as a key component. In this class, "reflection" (which could mean anything), will mean "the ability to talk about what you have done in terms meaningful to people outside of the University".

> Many parts of Herodotus, particularly Book 1, are self-contained stories; these can often read very much like the parables found in the New Testament. Like those parables, the stories from Herodotus can often apply to modern situations and provide insight. Unlike those parables, the stories from Herodotus are not that widely known. If you can remember a small handful of what you will read in this semester, you can use them later—in business, in conversation—to cast ancient light on modern problems.
