# CLS-220, Greek Civilization

C. Blackwell, Department of Classics

TTh 10:00–11:15

Furman Hall 111

## Overview

There are many ways we could spend a semester learning about ancient Greek Civilization, but in this instance of CLS 220 we are going to rely an a truly primary source: Herodotus of Halicarnassus, whose *Histories* was a massive project in explaining Greek Civilization to ancient Greek readers. We will focus on Book 1 of the *Histories*, reading slowly, looking things up, and engaging with the text in a variety of (hopefully) analytical and creative ways. The class will provide some context for this early act of writing, as well as some hands-on experience with digital tools of humanist inquiry.


## Resources

- Strassler, Robert B., Herodotus, and Rosalind Thomas. *The Landmark Herodotus: The Histories.* Translated by Andrea L. Purvis. Reprint edition. New York: Anchor Books, 2009.
- Various digital tools.
- The [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor.

### Notes

- **Quizzes** These will be daily affairs, very short. You will grade your own. (We will talk about how this works in class). If you are not present, you will earn a zero. If you are present and hand *anything* in, you will earn at least 80% for that quiz. If you score more than 80% on a quiz, you will earn what you score. I will drop any zero resulting from an excused absence. I will drop any three other zeros.
- **Midterm** This will be a test of your understanding and insight more than a test of your memory.
- **Engagement** This will be my subjective assessment of your engagement with the material *and with the class*. The class is a team engaged in solving a problem: how to understand Greek Civilization through a reading of Herodotus. As a member of that team you are expected to be supportive, active, respectful, cheerful, and as helpful as you can. Each member of the class will bring particular strengths.
- **Project** In lieu of a final exam, you will define (with my help) a project, carry it out, and present it to the class.
- **Resourcefullness** You are not yet an expert in Greek Civilization, nor are you good at the tools and techniques we will learn. This will be my subjective assessment of the extent to which you work to help yourself, to solve your own problem, to find answers to your questions, and to avoid being generally helpless.
