# FYW: Writing & Editing Assignment

The main project for this class will be a *digital edition* of an English translation of an ancient work. This assignment will be accomplished in parts. The result will be the "project" and the "final essay" noted on the syllabus. Together they will constitute 40% of the final grade, but they will be graded incrementally.

## Step One: Presentation 

(1/4 of the 40% of Final Essay Grade, 10% of final grade.)

A Keynote or Powerpoint presentation of **no more than 7 minutes**, teaching an audience about your chosen story or figure, offering basic information and compelling illustrations.

You will prepare a **script** for your presentation, in the form of a Markdown document. 

You will prepare a **presentation** following your script. This will consist of a few slides, either showing easily-digestable information or an illustration (or both). 

You will present your work to the class, following **but not reading verbatim** from your script.

| Points | Graded Item |
|--------|-------------|
| 2      | Script: grammar, syntax, spelling |
| 2      | Script: technical aspects, Markdown, `.docx` conversion |
| 4      | Script: content |
| 2      | Presentation: tasteful design     |
| 2      | Presentation: on time |
| 6      | Presentation: content | 
| 2      | Presentation: delivery |
| **25** | **Total Points** |

For this, you can rely on the text alone; you do not need to do original research. At a subsequent stage, you will have to find other sources for the topics discussed in your passage.
