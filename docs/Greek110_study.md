## Practicum

There will be an in-class test, on **December 11**, on the alphabet, the names of cases, numbers, genders, tenses, voices, moods, and the *forms of the definite article*. This will take approximately 30 minutes. Students with accommodations should remind me, and you can arrange to take this at the testing center.

There will be a take-home component, due **December 14 at 5:00**. There will be a few questions for you to answer with short paragraphs. In addition you can expect to get, by **Monday, December 10**, via a `git pull` a new set of sentences, based on the vocabulary and forms from Units 1–4. You will be asked to submit a MS Word analysis of those sentences, and a translation of them. Note that getting the sentences via `git pull`, and processing them is part of the assignment.
