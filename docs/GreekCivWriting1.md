## Topics

Herodotus goes all over the place as he works to prevent deeds from being forgotten, to recount marvels, and to explain the Persian Wars. You, students in this class, are all over the place in your interests and plans. So your assignment is to take *one* or *two* topics we have covered thus far in Herodotus and relate them to some circumstance you expect to face in your life after graduation.

From Herodotus, it can be anything (there is a list of "topics discussed" on the course website). For your expected personal experience, it can be anything—personal, professional, recreational. If you plan to become billionaire-rich, for example, or if you are an avid boar-hunter, you might look at something about Croesus. If you plan on having a family, Candaules' story might have some tips on spousal communication. You life will certainly involve planning of some sort or another, so the various Oracles we've seen might be something to consider (you do not have to believe, personally, that Apollo speaks out of Delphi to learn from Herodotus' oracle-stories).

One way to approach this, is to picture yourself in a conversation at dinner with your family, at a reception with your co-workers, or at a bar with your friends. Think of some story from Herodotus that you might dig up from your memory and tell, and the circumstances (family, co-workers, friends) that might prompt your telling that story.

Or, if you imagine yourself working with information—finance, law, intelligence, policy—you might imagine some kind of report, brief, or memo you might be called on to write, and find an appropriate short anecdote from Herodotus to introduce it.

Divide your one essay or two essays evenly between re-telling the topics, story, or theme from Herodotus, and explaining the circumstances in which it is relevent. 

I will grade this on:

- Getting it done, on time, and of the correct length. 
- **Giving me a citation to the part of Herodotus you are talking about, like** "(Herodotus 1.65)" or "(Herodotus 1.65-1.66)"
- Typing your paper and having your name on it.
- Accuracy (getting Herododutus right)
- Fit between circumstance and episode from Herodotus 
- General quality of writing. If you would like some help with that next weeek, let me know.
